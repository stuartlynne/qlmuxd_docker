# 
# Build two containers:
#
#   qllabels_qlmuxd - QLABELS.py configured to use qlmuxd
#   qlmuxd - Brother QL printer spooler
#
# N.B. Printing directly to Brother QL Printers is not supported and not prevented.
#
# qlmuxd implements a printer spooler that allows multiple printers to be shared
# with fall-over if (when) printers fail (out of labels, cover open, jam, etc).
#
# This configuration should be used when the printers are shared and/or you
# want fall-over to backup printers.
#
# RaceDB Configuration: ssh racedb@qllabels.local QLLABELS.py $1
